# EM:IP Cover Graphic Showcase Submissions

This repository contains submissions to the cover graphic competition for *Educational Measurement: Issues and Practice*.
Each submission contains code to generate the graphic, a description, a `.png` of the submitted graphic, and (if selected as a winner) links to the published version.
All cover graphics can be seen in the [cover gallery](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/page/journal/17453992/homepage/cover_gallery.htm).
